## This project is a Java-based ticket-selling system developed for the concert event "Grand BINIverse", which spans three days. The system offers six ticket types with varying prices and features. It enables customers to purchase tickets, manage reservations, and ensures that all ticket data is securely stored in a relational database. The system manages ticket reservations and availability separately for each day of the 3-day concert, dynamically tracking reserved and available seats to prevent overbooking. Additionally, it saves customer, ticket, and payment information in a MySQL database, ensuring efficient data management and future reference.
